# tw_monitor_speaker
Modeling Two-Way Monitor Speakers, including crossovers, from acoustical and physical first principles. This project is a work in progress.

For completed modelling of a single driver see: https://github.com/eridgraves/single_driver_br_python

I completed my build of two-way monitor speakers in 2/2020. The code in this repo is from my modelling efforts for them.
